This code analyzes the impact of US stock market data on Bitcoin prices using a dataset spanning from February 4, 2019, to February 2, 2024. The findings indicate that Bitcoin prices can be predicted based on US stock market commodity prices, highlighting the influence of specific market elements on Bitcoinâ€™s value.

Several machine learning models were employed to predict Bitcoin prices using stock market commodities and asset prices. Vector AutoRegression (VAR) used to analyze the interdependencies between multiple time series variables, Linear Regression provided an approach to understanding the linear relationship between Bitcoin and selected commodities. SVR captured non-linear dependencies, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) was applied as a method relying on data proximity. Decision Tree and Random Forest models used hierarchical splitting and ensemble learning to improve prediction accuracy. These models were evaluated using metrics such as max error, mean absolute error (MAE), mean squared error (MSE), root mean squared error (RMSE), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), and mean absolute scaled error (MASE). A rolling forecast strategy was employed, significantly improving MASE values. Despite hyperparameter optimization, no model achieved a MASE lower than 3, indicating the need for more advanced techniques.To further refine predictions, additional methods were explored, including MLP Regressor, Gradient Boosting, Kalman Filtering, and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks (Fig 5). The Gradient Boosting Regressor yielded the best results, achieving a MASE of 1.9 when using a rolling forecast. Gradient Boosting excels in this case because it sequentially corrects errors by optimizing weak learners, making it highly effective for capturing complex, non-linear relationships between Bitcoin prices and stock market elements. Unlike tree-based models that may suffer from overfitting or SVR, which struggles with scalability, Gradient Boosting efficiently learns from residual errors, ensuring improved accuracy over time. This makes it the most suitable approach for Bitcoin price prediction in this study.
